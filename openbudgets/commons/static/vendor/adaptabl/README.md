# Adaptabl

## What is it

Adaptabl is a modular stylesheet toolkit written in LESS.

It provides some sensible defaults, a minimal framework for responsive design, and some helpers for idiomatic styling patterns.

There is no grid (but you can make one), and it is not a "batteries included" framework like Bootstrap.

It is a toolkit.

Adaptabl is best used in LESS: include Adaptabl and start mixing in.

## Dependencies

If you just use the compiled adaptabl.css file, you're good to go. If you want to work in LESS with Adaptabl (as recommended), then you need LESS either client side or server side to compile to CSS.
