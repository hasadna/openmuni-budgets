            <p>
                Adaptabl is a small toolkit for writing CSS. It is not a framework like Bootstrap; the goals are decidedly different.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adaptabl is simply a small library of mixins and variables, combined with normalize.css for cross-browser consistency. It has a strong emphasis on BIDI support (RTL languages).

                There is not much to see here, but soon we'll add some links to sites built with Adaptabl.
